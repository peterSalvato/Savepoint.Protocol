# Savepoint.Protocol ‚Äì Project Roadmap

This document outlines the planned growth of the Savepoint Protocol system‚Äîtechnically, semantically, and structurally. The protocol is not just a tool but an evolving method for recursive thought, authorship, and time-based understanding.

---

## Phase 0 ‚Äì Foundations (Complete)

- [x] Functional modular CLI tool (`sp`)
- [x] Core subcommand: `extract`
- [x] Live flag-based + prompt-fallback interface
- [x] Semantically structured output (`.md`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.meta.txt`)
- [x] Proper authorship attribution and MIT licensing
- [x] `install.sh` + `--uninstall` flow
- [x] GitHub repo structured for modularity
- [x] All source code protected and versioned
- [x] History scrubbed of oversized file commits

---

## Phase 1 ‚Äì CLI Growth & Release

- [ ] Tag first public release (`v0.1.0`)
- [ ] Add versioned changelog
- [ ] Build out `sp drop` subcommand for manual Savepoint creation
- [ ] Add `sp install` functionality for modular protocol components
- [ ] Expand `README.md` into a full repo index
- [ ] Begin structured `/docs/` documentation (system, CLI, semweb)

---

## Phase 2 ‚Äì Timeline + Savepoint Mapping

- [ ] Explore cross-session timeline visualization
- [ ] Track overlapping topics across sessions
- [ ] Represent state of understanding over time (via flatlog)
- [ ] Introduce semantic ID scaffolding for Savepoints (e.g. `AE093_0416_1422`)
- [ ] Begin `sp annotate` or `sp timeline` tooling
- [ ] Sketch field kit versioning and user-defined taxonomies

---

## Phase 3 ‚Äì Web Interface Prototype

- [ ] Design upload + extraction interface (HTML/JS)
- [ ] Option A: All-client webtool (in-browser export parsing)
- [ ] Option B: Local Python/Node backend for ZIP export
- [ ] Option C: Hosted server with API + zip output
- [ ] Align CLI and Web outputs for interchangeability
- [ ] Optional: Connect to NotebookLM or export scaffolds

---

## Phase 4 ‚Äì Distribution & Systemization

- [ ] Package Savepoint Protocol CLI as a standalone `.tar.gz` or `.deb`
- [ ] Create Homebrew-style or one-liner installer for long-term use
- [ ] Add version locking, update-checking
- [ ] Begin semantic core documentation (doctrine, method, reference)
- [ ] Evaluate TM/copyright for naming conventions

---

## System Identity Notes

- ‚ÄúSavepoint.Protocol‚Äù is authored intellectual property.
- Used as both naming convention and conceptual method.
- The CLI tool supports, but does not define, the protocol.
- Future structure will separate philosophical documentation from utility interface.

---

## üßæ Status Tags

- üü¢ = complete
- üü° = in progress
- üî¥ = not started
- üß™ = exploratory or optional
