## Purpose

This document defines:

- How Savepoint.Protocol evolves
- How drift is tracked and interpreted
- How team environments enforce or challenge protocol rules
- Who holds semantic authorship and how recursive changes are governed

This is not bureaucratic.  
It is architectural.

---

## Sovereign Authorship

All Savepoints are authored.  
All protocol changes are authored.  
Savepoint.Protocol does not allow anonymous structural evolution.

The core syntax, naming, and purpose of the protocol are the intellectual property of its creator.  
This governance structure protects that authorship while allowing transparent recursion and community alignment.

---

## Drift Arbitration

A `drift_detected` Savepoint is used to mark:
- Misalignment between behavior and protocol
- LLM deviation from format
- Team divergence from rules
- Systematic misunderstanding

When drift occurs, it must be:
- Marked via Savepoint (`function:drift_detected`)
- Interpreted via prompt (`prompts.md`)
- Reviewed at the team or author level
- Never erased—only reflected on recursively

Drift is not a failure.  
It is a reflection boundary.

---

## Protocol Changes

Savepoint format or structural changes must be:

- Issued in the `version.log.md`
- Anchored via a Savepoint of `function:protocol_change`
- Included in the `.savepoints/` semantic ledger

Example Savepoint for version shift:

```plaintext
<Savepoint
  protocol_version:3.0
  category:protocol_evolution
  function:version_upgrade
  timestamp:2025-04-15T11:00:00Z
  # We are transitioning to v3.1 to support embedded authorship fields.
/>

Protocol changes are:

    Declared

    Authored

    Traversable

Team Reflection Protocols

Teams using Savepoint.Protocol may establish:

    Shared Savepoint directories (per user or project)

    Agreement on which drift types require group review

    function: namespace extensions for internal purposes

    Savepoint overlays layered by role, perspective, or time

All team-generated Savepoints are subordinate to:

    The canonical syntax.md

    The active version.log.md

    Authorship logic declared in this document

Forking

Savepoint.Protocol may be conceptually adapted, but not rebranded, forked, or restructured for commercial or derivative systems.

    Forking of syntax or Savepoint logic is not permitted.

    You may layer systems on top of Savepoints.

    You may extend team behavior via Savepoints.

    You may not claim authorship or identity outside permitted overlays.

This protocol is designed to scale, not fragment.
