## Overview

Savepoints are not notes.  
They are **signal-beacons**—semantic flares fired at moments that matter.

Their purpose is **not to be collected** but to **be encountered**—especially when traversing a conversation, document, or reflection system.

They are declarations, not documentation.  
You write them **so you can return to them**—or so a system can.

## Example 1: Flagging a Drift in a Live Session

```plaintext
<Savepoint
  protocol_version:3.0
  category:runtime_disagreement
  function:drift_detected
  timestamp:2025-04-08T20:58:00Z
  # Assistant defaulted to markdown block when v3.0 specifies self-closing syntax. Realigned.
/>

This Savepoint acts as:

    A cognitive checkpoint

    A semantic warning for later traversal

    A prompt to course-correct the session

Example 2: Marking a Turning Point

<Savepoint
  protocol_version:3.0
  category:project_commitment
  function:inflection
  timestamp:2025-04-08T21:00:00Z
  # We shifted from ideation into execution. System boundary conditions now locked.
/>

This Savepoint:

    Signals a change in project state

    Allows agents or readers to enter post-commit phase

    Acts as a reentry point for version-aware recursion

Example 3: Issued by GPT Mid-Conversation

<Savepoint
  protocol_version:3.0
  category:meta_response
  function:signal_beacon
  timestamp:2025-04-08T21:02:00Z
  # User clarified Savepoints are for traversal, not collection. System ontology corrected.
/>

This would be generated by ChatGPT or another AI agent, mid-session, when:

    A protocol rule is clarified

    A user-level distinction is confirmed

    The assistant needs to anchor the shift for future reference

Example 4: Reentry Point for Future Self

<Savepoint
  protocol_version:3.0
  category:recursive_onboarding
  function:reentry_marker
  timestamp:2025-04-08T21:04:00Z
  # If returning here from a future drift, resume with version-history.md and cross-reference today's manifest.
/>

This is not a note.
It's a designed landing pad.
Example 5: Intentional Drift Acknowledgment

<Savepoint
  protocol_version:3.0
  category:protocol_theory
  function:intentional_drift
  timestamp:2025-04-08T21:06:00Z
  # Breaking syntax convention here to test recursive tolerance. This Savepoint knowingly deviates.
/>

Used only when:

    You know you’re breaking protocol

    And you want to make it visible as part of a recursive process

Traversal Behavior

During review or interaction (whether human or machine):

    Savepoints allow thread re-entry

    They can be parsed, prompted, or collapsed into logs

    Agents may emit Savepoints as self-governance tools

    You may search for function:drift_detected or category:reentry_marker to navigate sessions

They are not for memory.
They are for precision return.
