## Purpose

This document defines prompt patterns that support:

- Recursive reentry via Savepoints
- Semantic traversal of prior cognition
- Cognitive drift detection
- AI alignment with protocol behavior

Prompts are not conversation starters.  
They are **semantic instruments**—tools for navigating nonlinear reflection.

---

## Prompt Design Principles

Prompts must:
- Respect the Savepoint as a sovereign authored moment
- Reinforce the protocol’s append-only structure
- Encourage recursion, not summarization
- Support drift correction, not erasure
- Allow reflection to deepen, not flatten

---

## Prompt: Savepoint Clarification

```text
If I returned to this Savepoint a year from now, what would I wish I had clarified before leaving it?

Use when:

    The Savepoint is ambiguous, intense, or under-defined

    You are uncertain what future-you will remember

Prompt: Reverse Drift

What belief or assumption might have shifted since this Savepoint was written?

Use when:

    You suspect you’ve drifted from prior intent or self

    You are reflecting recursively across versions of your own thought

Prompt: Semantic Reentry

What was the context surrounding this Savepoint—and what do I now see differently?

Use when:

    Re-entering a conversation, notebook, or session

    Using a Savepoint as a semantic return vector

Prompt: Team Overlay Review

What insight, question, or contradiction does this Savepoint introduce when layered with the others from this session?

Use when:

    Working in team overlays or group reflection

    Comparing perspectives across semantic anchors

Prompt: Drift-Detected Reasoning

What protocol principle was violated or challenged at this point—and why was it significant?

Use when:

    Reviewing a drift_detected Savepoint

    Conducting a recursion audit

Prompt: Self-Alignment Recheck

If I wrote this Savepoint again today, what would change—and what wouldn’t?

Use when:

    Checking continuity of self

    Distinguishing evolution from drift

How to Use These

Prompts can be:

    Written into a Savepoint itself (function:prompted_reflection)

    Asked post hoc in AI conversations

    Issued by systems traversing Savepoints in logs

    Applied recursively to older Savepoints as an orientation tool

They are not just questions.
They are recursive cognitive interfaces.
