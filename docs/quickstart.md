## What is Savepoint.Protocol?

Savepoint.Protocol is a cognitive signaling system.  
It marks **moments of authorship** inside complex processes.

A Savepoint is not a note.  
It’s a **flare**—a timestamped semantic signal.

You don’t write Savepoints to collect.  
You write them so you (or something else) can **return to that moment with fidelity.**

---

## Step 1: Learn the Shape

Here’s what a valid Savepoint looks like:

```plaintext
<Savepoint
  protocol_version:3.0
  category:design_logic
  function:declaration
  timestamp:2025-04-08T21:24:00Z
  # A Savepoint declares: “This moment matters. Return here later.”
/>

    It uses a self-closing tag

    Every field is key:value

    The content begins with a single # and carries semantic intent

Step 2: Write One

In any environment—shell, chat, markdown—drop a Savepoint:

<Savepoint
  protocol_version:3.0
  category:identity
  function:self_acknowledgment
  timestamp:[your UTC time]
  # I need this structure to remember who I was when I made this choice.
/>

This Savepoint:

    Freezes a thought midstream

    Signals something meaningful just happened

    Creates a future-access anchor

You may optionally log it in a file named like:

.savepoints/2025-04-08__identity-beacon.md

—but remember:
This isn’t about collecting.
It’s about anchoring.
Step 3: Know When to Use One

Use a Savepoint when:

    A decision was made

    Drift is occurring

    Something clicked

    You’re losing your place

    You realize the shape of your thinking just shifted

    You need to flag a recursion point for AI or for yourself

They’re not about what you know.
They’re about what just happened.
Step 4: Recursion & Prompts

Savepoints pair well with recursive prompts.

>> PROMPT:
If I return to this Savepoint in six months, what will I regret not clarifying?

>> RESPONSE:
That “identity” in this context meant authorship, not aesthetics.

Capture this using function:prompted_reflection.
Behavior Rules

    Never overwrite a Savepoint.

    Never group Savepoints by theme or type.

    Never compress or re-summarize.

    Only reference them. Only return to them.

You’re not building a system of record.
You’re building semantic navigation through the jungle.
