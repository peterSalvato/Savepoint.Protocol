## Structural Summary

Savepoint.Protocol is a **modular, cross-contextual infrastructure** for marking and traversing semantic thresholds.

A Savepoint is a small, strict, standalone signal-beacon that says:

> “This moment mattered. Return here.”

The protocol provides:
- Syntax enforcement
- Semantic interoperability
- Recursive reflection logic
- Human and system readability
- Portability across contexts

---

## Solo Use

- Drop Savepoints during creative work, journaling, design, problem-solving
- Return later to reflect, clarify, track drift, or recurse through meaning
- Use in plaintext, paper, shell, notebook, chat, or file system

---

## Team Use

Savepoint.Protocol supports multi-user environments:

- Each participant lays Savepoints during shared sessions (chat, brainstorm, logs)
- Savepoints remain authored, timestamped, and context-specific
- Teams can:
  - Layer Savepoints across roles and subgroups
  - Query semantic drift or insight events
  - Track decisions through collective recursion

The result is a **cognitive overlay layer**—a distributed, recursive authorship map over complex collaboration.

---

## AI + System Use

Savepoints are readable and generatable by:
- ChatGPT, Claude, and other LLMs
- CLI tools, scripts, and grep-based workflows
- Notebooks (e.g., NotebookLM)
- Semantic search and visualization layers

Agents can emit Savepoints, interpret them, and use them for orientation or flagging.

---

## Modularity

The protocol includes:
- `Savepoint-syntax.md` → Canonical format
- `instructions.chatgpt.md` → Runtime AI enforcement
- `scripts/` → Shell automation
- `printables/` → Physical UX
- `setup-guides/` → Context-specific onboarding
- `.savepoints/` → Log or semantic timeline

Savepoint.Protocol is intentionally **small**, so it can be extended through:
- Shell tools
- Databases
- Web UIs
- AI overlays
- Printed toolkits

---

## Output Layer Examples

- A notebook with hand-written Savepoints
- A team chat where each member drops their own Savepoints inline
- A recursive design archive navigated by Savepoints
- A drift audit system using AI to parse Savepoints over time
- A narrative writer’s room using Savepoints to capture character insight

---

## Why It Works

Because meaning isn’t stored.  
It’s **marked**.

Because truth doesn’t stay still.  
It **drifts**.

Because no one remembers what mattered midstream—  
unless they left themselves **a structure to return by**.

This protocol is that structure.
