## Purpose

This file serves as a formal declaration of authorship, invention, and original authorship intent for the **Savepoint.Protocol** project.

## Authorship

The Savepoint.Protocol system — including its terminology, markup syntax, semantic framing, fallback hierarchy, and design philosophy — was originally conceived, authored, and documented by **Peter Salvato** in 2025.

This repository constitutes the canonical record of invention.

## Scope of Protection

This declaration applies to the following intellectual contributions:

- The concept of “Savepoints” as semantic cognitive anchors in reflective workflows  
- The hybrid markup structure (`<session>`, `<savepoint>`, `#tags`) designed for graceful degradation across AI and grep-based tooling  
- The multi-tier synthesis compatibility model (NotebookLM > LLM > grep)  
- The framing of markup as **non-synthetic, traversal-first cognitive infrastructure**  
- The tone, structure, and operational philosophy of the Savepoint.Protocol as a **neutral cognitive scaffold**, independent of any brand, company, or commercial identity

## Licensing

This repository is licensed under the terms specified in `LICENSE.md`. This declaration is not a substitute for license terms but clarifies authorship and provenance.

## Relationship to Other Projects

Savepoint.Protocol is **independent of the Order of the Ætherwright** and does not share naming conventions, brand language, or system dependencies. Any structural similarities reflect common authorship but do not indicate integration.

## Legal Position

While the Savepoint.Protocol is not a commercial product, it constitutes original creative and systems work subject to copyright and IP protections under applicable law. The design, terminology, and documentation are protected accordingly.
