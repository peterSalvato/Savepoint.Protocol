Savepoint.Protocol is a structured way to mark, return to, and reason through nonlinear thought—solo, with teams, or with AI.

## What Is This?

Savepoint.Protocol is not a note-taking system.  
It is a **semantic cartography framework**—a system for marking, returning to, and reasoning through nonlinear thought.

Whether used solo, in teams, or with AI assistance, Savepoints act as **structured signal-beacons** laid down during moments of conceptual shift, uncertainty, drift, or realization.

They are not written to be remembered.  
They are written to be **returned to**—with fidelity, recursion, and orientation.

## Core Concept: Jungle Cartography

When navigating real thought—creative work, reflection, research—you are moving through dense, unmapped jungle. The structure isn’t clear. The terrain shifts beneath you.

As you move, you drop Savepoints:
- Semantic flares
- Timestamped declarations
- Cognitive landmarks

You don’t write them for polish. You write them **midstream**—to mark what matters.  
Later, you or your system can **return to those beacons**—to reenter, reflect, or realign.

This is not a tracking tool. It is **cognitive cartography**.

## Key Properties

- **Structured**: Every Savepoint uses a precise, machine- and human-readable format
- **Recursive**: Built for reentry and multi-pass interpretation
- **Cross-modal**: Works in shell, chat, AI, journal, notebook, group thread, or field notes
- **Team-ready**: Enables layered authorship, drift detection, and semantic overlays
- **Protective**: Terminology and structure are IP-guarded and non-replicable

## Solo, Team, System Use

Savepoint.Protocol supports:
- Solo creative practice
- AI-assisted recursive thought
- Group cognition overlays (each person marking flares in shared terrain)
- Flat file or database traversal
- Printed analog toolkits

At every scale, the Savepoint acts as a durable semantic anchor.

## Get Started

See:

- [`docs/quickstart.md`](docs/quickstart.md) → Write your first Savepoint
- [`docs/philosophy.md`](docs/philosophy.md) → Understand the jungle cartography model
- [`docs/Savepoint-syntax.md`](docs/Savepoint-syntax.md) → v3.0 canonical structure
- [`docs/examples.md`](docs/examples.md) → Real Savepoints in real scenarios

Savepoint.Protocol is an authorship scaffold—recursive, minimal, sovereign, and enduring.  
This is how we mark where it mattered.
