## Trace your thinking. Don’t just remember—author.  
*Savepoint is the machete, not the map.*

Savepoint.Protocol™ is a symbolic markup system for capturing cognitive turning points—moments when realization clicks, phrasing locks in, or meaning shifts direction.

It’s not memory. It’s authorship infrastructure.  
Built for thinkers in wild terrain.

Savepoints are not summaries. Not notes. Not metadata.
They are semantic trail markers—a protocol for claiming where your thinking changed.

---

## Why Savepoint Exists (Framing Context)

Modern systems—especially AI—are building passive memory: endless recall, zero perspective.

They remember everything, but not what mattered.
They store what you said, but not what changed you.

This is the problem: **black box memory**. You can search your history but not trace your authorship.

Savepoint.Protocol exists to solve that.

- It captures *semantic inflection*—when something clicked
- It preserves *your phrasing*—not just data
- It restores authorship in a sea of machine retention

Whether you’re writing, designing, debugging, or philosophizing: Savepoints let you track when meaning moved.

---

## What Savepoint Is

A Savepoint is:
- A self-authored realization
- Timestamped and structured
- Stored in plaintext, written by hand, or parsed from AI logs
- A system-agnostic **semantic artifact**

You don’t need a platform. You need a symbol.

---

## Canonical Syntax (v3.0)

Savepoints are declared using a self-closing tag:

```plaintext
<Savepoint
  protocol_version:3.0
  category:system_logic
  function:declaration
  timestamp:2025-04-08T15:43:00Z
  importance:high
  influence:Order of the Ætherwright
  # Recursive structures should replace version snapshots wherever drift is likely.
/>
```

### Required Fields
- `protocol_version`: always declared (current = 3.0)  
- `category`: domain of reflection (e.g. `design_note`, `model_shift`)  
- `function`: purpose (`declaration`, `revision`, `drift_detected`)  
- `timestamp`: ISO 8601 UTC format  
- `#`: the actual semantic content

### Optional Fields
- `importance`: high, medium, low  
- `confidence`: self-assessed certainty  
- `influence`: source, reference, or attribution

## Use Cases

- Writers marking breakthroughs in phrasing or structure
- Designers noting system shifts or metaphor realignment
- Researchers capturing conceptual pivots
- Developers logging architecture changes in thinking
- Philosophers flagging turns in internal logic

---

## CLI Tool

A Python CLI tool is included to extract Savepoints from exported ChatGPT logs:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/peterSalvato/savepoint-protocol.git
cd savepoint-protocol
python cli/savepoint_split.py conversations.json
```

- Parses logs into Savepoint `.md` entries
- Timestamps and Git-prepares each session
- Requires Python 3.7+

Tool: [cli/savepoint_split.py](https://github.com/peterSalvato/savepoint-protocol/blob/main/cli/savepoint_split.py)

## Repository Structure

/spec/ – Canonical protocol format and rules  
/cli/ – CLI tool (ChatGPT log parser)  
/examples/ – Sample Savepoint sessions  
/.savepoints/ – Real Savepoint logs  
/docs/ – Extended philosophy and integration

---

## Philosophy

Savepoint is not a tool. It’s a symbolic language for tracing what matters.

It is:
- Low-tech
- High-trust
- Stack-agnostic
- Format-degradable
- Legible to LLMs and legible to you

It resists feature creep.
It honors inflection over information.
It builds cognitive version control—not just note capture.

When the forest regrows, the Savepoints remain.
