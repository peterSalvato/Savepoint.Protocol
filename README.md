# Savepoint Protocol

**Trace your thinking.
Don’t just remember—author.**  

_Savepoint is the machete, not the map._

Savepoint Protocol is a minimal, timestamped markup system for capturing **cognitive turning points**—the moments when phrasing lands, realizations click, or meaning shifts.

It’s not memory. It’s authorship infrastructure.  
Built for thinkers in wild terrain.

## Semantic Cartography for the Mind

> Thought doesn’t arrive in order. It arrives like a jungle—dense, recursive, and overgrown.  
> Savepoint Protocol isn’t a vault. It’s a **trail marker system**.

Each `<savepoint>` is a deliberate notch in your cognitive path:  
You were **here**. This **mattered**. Come back **if needed**.

## Why Savepoint Exists

As AI systems adopt passive memory, the risk isn’t forgetting—it’s **losing authorship**.

- AI memory captures facts.  
- **You** capture meaning.

Savepoint helps you:
- Preserve phrasing that *locked in*
- Mark realizations that *reframed everything*
- Trace how your thoughts actually *evolved*

It’s for writers, designers, researchers, coders—  
**anyone who thinks recursively and wants to leave a trail.**

## How It Works

Each Savepoint session is a timestamped `.md` log—  
lightweight, versionable, and machine-readable.

```txt
<session 2025-04-10-2 | Savepoint.Protocol | opened 16:04>

<savepoint 16:07>
That metaphor finally locked in: “Savepoints aren’t memories, they’re commits.”
#language #realization

<savepoint 16:13>
This changes the purpose of the spec—this isn’t note-taking, this is cartography.
#framing #specification
